    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-ravelry"></i> He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke.
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-ravelry"></i> From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable maturity for his age and knowledge on how to deal with every situation.
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-ravelry"></i> For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a rather humble man. Never arrogant about his own abilities nor underestimating others, most things he said would be unbiased and accurate.
    </br></br>
    </br></br>    
    <i class="icon-ravelry"></i> As a seven-year-old, his reasoning was on par with a Hokage. Having studied history, not just of his clan or his village but of the world, he gained a broader appreciation of what was important.
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-ravelry"></i> Learning so much enabled him to understand how events of the past came to happen and, when he applied that same understanding into the future, he became concerned for where things were going
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-ravelry"></i> He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so that he could fully understand them.
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-comment"></i>“If you want to know who you are, you have to look at your real self and acknowledge what you see.”
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-comment"></i>"However strong you become, never seek to bear everything alone. If you do, failure is certain."
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-comment"></i>"Can we consider them to be simply living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?"
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-comment"></i>"People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define ‘reality’. But what does it mean to be ‘correct’ or ‘true’? Merely vague concepts... Their ‘reality’ may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?""
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-comment"></i>“Self-sacrifice... A nameless shinobi who protects peace within its shadow. That is a true shinobi.”
    </br></br>
    </br></br>
    <i class="icon-comment"></i>I’ll admit that you’re stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what’s truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It’s because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you’ll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn’t mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends!”
